# Important information (04/2021)

**04/2021: The label format changed from .yml to .json**. This should help to load the dataset significantly faster (especially in Python). Moreover the following changed:

1. **Class Identity is replaced by attributes dictionary**. The attributes dictionary contains the keys "direction", "relevance", "occlusion", "orientation", "aspects", "state" and "pictogram". New since v2.0 is the "reflection" attribute.
2. Some labels may have the items **("aspects", "unknown"), ("state", "unknown") or ("pictogram", "unknown")**. This differs to the labels in the yml format, which always had one default value even if the label information changed. Note that due to this your results on json max differ to .yml
3. **MATLAB reader is deprecated**. If you want to use .json in MATLAB you have to write your own reader. Do not hesitate to create a pull request.
4. **API in C++ and Python** slightly **changed**. Take a look into the code!

The amount of overall images is **NOT** changed. The image data itself is also untouched. Number of objects is increased because many overlooked and reflected traffic lights are added. For some instances, wrong state and pictogram attribute label is corrected!

**For everybody who still wants to work with the old .yml files: You can simply checkout the state tagged as "v1.0".**

### Route structure
We separated each drive in one city into different routes

    .
    ├── Berlin                # Berlin
        ├── Berlin1           # First route
        ├── Berlin2           # Second route
        ├── Berlin3           # Third route
        ├── ...
### Sequence structure
We separated each route into several sequences. One sequence describes one unique intersection up to passing it. The foldername indicates date and time.

    .
    ├── Berlin 1                    # Route Berlin1
        ├── 2015-04-17_10-50-05     # First intersection
        ├── 2015-04-17_10-50-41     # Second intersection
        ├── ...

### Image structure
For each sequences, images and disparity images are available. Filename indicates time and date

    .
    ├── 2015-04-17_10-50-05                                      # Route Berlin1
        ├── DE_BBBR667_2015-04-17_10-50-13-633939_k0.tiff        # First left camera image
        ├── DE_BBBR667_2015-04-17_10-50-13-633939_nativeV2.tiff  # First disparity image
        ├── DE_BBBR667_2015-04-17_10-50-14-299876_k0.tiff        # Second left camera image
        ├── DE_BBBR667_2015-04-17_10-50-14-299876_nativeV2       # Second disparity image
        ├── ...
## Before starting
#### 1. Check our documentation
Documentation is stored at /dtld_parsing/doc/. We give insights into the data and explain how to interpret it.
#### 2. Change absolute paths
Do not forget to change the absolute paths of the images in all label files (.yml).

## Using the dataset
### C++

1. Clone the dtld_parsing respository
```Shell
git clone https://github.com/julimueller/dtld_parsing
```
2. Build everything
```Shell
1. cd dtld_parsing/c++/driveu_dataset/
2. mkdir build && cd build
3. cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="YOUR_PATH" && make -j12 install
4. driveu_test -label_file <label_file_path.yml> -calib_dir <path_to_calib> -data_base_dir <dtld_dir>

```
Note: "YOUR_PATH" has to be in LD_LIBRARY_PATH. DTLD_DIR is the directory where all .zips should be unpacked.
The visualization should look like this

### Python
UPDATE 03-26-2020: Python modules were changed to Python 3.
```Shell
git clone https://github.com/julimueller/dtld_parsing
cd dtld_parsing
python3 setup.py install
cd python
python3 load_dtld.py --label_file <label_file_path.yml> --calib_dir <path_to_calib> --data_base_dir <dtld_dir>

```
Result should look like above
### MATLAB

NOTE 04/2021: MATLAB support is deprecated and will likely not be added for the new label format (json).

Run main.m

Results should look like this
